Altough it can detect characters on other similar captchas

## Request model for bypass
If you have encountered a captcha that you wish to bypass using AI, you can make an issue with this info:
- Discord bot name
- A dataset of images/examples (just the images, no labels) in a zip file
- (optional) ways of making it easier to bypass/read
- (important) if the captcha case-sensitive
